User Guide
==========

The Sous Vide simulation used is providing different tools to support users in Sous Vide cooking, taking care of the state-of-the-art safety directions.

Particularly, each page provide a different functionality:

* **üë®‚Äçüç≥ Quick simulation**: compute time required to safely sous-vide cook with             
* **üå°Ô∏è Check pasteurization at cooking time** collect temperature measurements at cooking time and evalute pasteurization progress
* **‚ô®Ô∏è Advanced simulation**: if you want to simulate the heat transfer with a full control on parameters and detailed results
* **‚öôÔ∏è Diffusivity estimation**: if you want to estimate the thermal diffusivity of a piece of meat based on a range of values
* **‚öôÔ∏è Reference tables**: if you want to compute sensitivity of thermal stability/pasteurization time with respect to different parameters  

Quick Simulation
----------------
It is a tool to quickly simulate required cooking time to reach acceptable safety levels, by specifing shape of the food, starting and final temperatures 
(all the other parameters are specified in a conservative way)

Steps:

* Go to the "Quick simulation" page
* Select the food inital temperature and roner temperature
* Select time you are foreseeing starting cooking
* Press "Run Simulation" and check results

Check pasteurization as cooking time
------------------------------------
It is a support tool where you can take notes of the measured temperature, estimate the foreseen cooking time
 and time when acceptable safety levels will be reached.

Steps:

* Go to the "Check pasteurization" page
* Set the roner temperature
* Start adding measured food temperature in the middle (e.g., one every 20 minutes for the first hour) 
* Look at the estimated pasteurization time
