# Mathematical basis

All the modeling is based on the heat conduction exchange equation in cylindric coordinates:

$$ 
\begin{cases}
T_t = \alpha \lbrace T_{rr} + \beta \frac{T_r}{r} \rbrace, \\
T(r, 0) = T_0, \quad T_r(0, t) = 0, \\
T_r(R, t) = \frac{h}{k} \lbrace T_{\text{Water}} - T(R, t) \rbrace,
\end{cases} \tag{*}
$$
 
Where: 
* $T_t \equiv \partial T / \partial t$, $T_r \equiv \partial T / \partial r$, $T_{rr} \equiv \partial ^2 T/\partial r^2$
* $r \in [0,R]$, representing the distance from the center of the food $0$ is the center, $R$ is the border at direct contect with the water
* $T_0$, is the initial temprature of the food, generally 5Â°C  
* $T(r,t)$, representing the temperature of the food at distance $r$ from the center at time $t$
* $\beta$, representing the geometry of the shape ($0$ for slab, $1$ for cylinder and $2$ for sphere)
* $T_{\text{Water}} $, representing the temperature set and maintained by the Roner

Furthermore, the reduction of the pathogens the Logaritmic Reduction (LR) is computed as follows:

$$
\text{LR} = \frac{1}{D_{\text{Ref}}} \int_0^t 10^{\frac{T(t') - T_{\text{Ref}}}{z}} dt', \tag{**}
$$

Where

* $D_{\text{Ref}}$ is equal to $20s^{-1}$  

## Discrete version

The simulator is based on `Scipy` solver, accordingly a discretize version of the equation $(*)$ has been used and below you may find the considerations behind the code.

**Heat conduction**

The main equation in spherical coordinates $T_t = \alpha \lbrace T_{rr} + \beta \frac{T_r}{r} \rbrace$ is discretizez as follows:

* for $r=0$ (center of the heated body):

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial ^2 T}{\partial r ^2} \approx \frac{T(\Delta r,t)-T(0,t)}{\Delta r^2 / 2} \tag{i}
$$

*   for $r\in (0,R)$, each term will be approximated with discretization, particularly:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    &\frac{\partial ^2 T}{\partial r^2} \approx \frac {T(r+\Delta r,t)- 2T(r,t)+T(r-\Delta r,t)}{\Delta r^2},  \\[10pt]
    &\frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \approx \frac {T(r+\Delta r,t)-T(r-\Delta r)}{2 \Delta r}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    and putting all together

    $$
    \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \approx \alpha \left[ \frac {T(r+\Delta r,t)- 2T(r,t)+T(r-\Delta r,t)}{\Delta r^2} + \frac {T(r+\Delta r,t)-T(r-\Delta r)}{2 \Delta r} \right] \tag{ii}
    $$

**Boundary Conditions**

Heat transfer at the border with the fluid (i.e., $r=R$) are modeled putting together Newton's law of heating and Fourier's thermal conductivity law, giving:

$$
\text{Heat transfer} = k \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \bigg|_{r=R} = -h \big(T(R,t) - T_\text{Water} \big)
$$

and performing a discrete approximation of the left hand side, where $T(R+\Delta r,t)$ is a fictious point outside the food:

$$
k\frac{T(R+\Delta r,t)-T(R, t)}{\Delta r} \approx -h \big(T(R,t) - T_\text{Water} \big)
$$

and rearranging to explicitly write for the fictious point $T(R+\Delta r,t)$:

$$
T(R+\Delta r,t) = T(R,t)-\frac{h \Delta r}{k}\big(T(R,t) - T_\text{Water} \big)
$$

Coming back to the main heat conduction equation, evaluating for $r=R$, performing discrete approximation and susbsituting previously computed formula for the temperature of fictious point:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \bigg|_{r=R} &= \alpha \frac{\partial ^2 T}{\partial r^2} \\
&\approx \alpha \frac{T(R-\Delta r,t)-2T(R,t)+ T(R+\Delta r,t)}{\Delta r^2} \\
&=\alpha \frac{T(R-\Delta r,t)-2T(R,t)+ T(R,t) - \frac{h \Delta r}{k}\big(T(R,t) - T_\text{Water} \big)}{\Delta r^2} \\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \bigg|_{r=R}&= \alpha \frac{T(R-\Delta r,t)-T(R,t) - \frac{h \Delta r}{k}\big(T(R,t) - T_\text{Water} \big)}{\Delta r^2}
\end{aligned} \tag{iii}
$$

By mapping equation terms into the following variables:

* $T(r,t)$ as `T[r]` for a given `t`
* $\partial T / \partial t (r,t)$ as `DTdt[r]` for a given `t`
* $\Delta r$ as `dr`

equations $(i)$, $(ii)$, $(iii)$ can be coded in Python as follows:

```
def heat_equation(t, T):
    dTdt = np.zeros_like(T)
    
    # Symmetry condition at r = 0
    dTdt[0] = msp.alpha * (2 / dr**2) * (T[1] - T[0])

    # Interior points
    for i in range(1, msp.N - 1):
        d2T_dr2 = (T[i+1] - 2*T[i] + T[i-1]) / dr**2
        radial_term = (msp.Beta / r[i]) * (T[i+1] - T[i-1]) / (2 * dr) if r[i] != 0 else 0
        dTdt[i] = msp.alpha * (d2T_dr2 + radial_term)
    
    # Convective boundary condition at the outer radius
    dTdt[-1] = msp.alpha * (1 / dr**2) * 
                (T[-2] - T[-1] - (dr * msp.h / msp.k) * (T[-1] - msp.T_fluid))
    
    return dTdt
